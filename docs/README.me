This is a basic rock, paper, scissor game created using javascript and firebase. Having it linked with
firebase allows for 2 users too use the application at once and go head to head against each other. Their 
score will be recorder on screen based on which decisions they choose. This is one of my first projects using
firebase and was helpfully in learning how it an be applied to my future projects.
